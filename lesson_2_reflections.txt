What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository a .git file is creted which will store meta data about repository and future commits. You have to initialize a repository to start using git, with out "git init" you can't use git version control at all.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a middle step between working directory and the repository. It offers a temporary place for files which are about to be commited.
